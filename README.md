# Unix Lab Codes

Welcome to my repository where I store all the Unix lab codes I've worked on. These scripts and programs cover various Unix concepts, commands, and system operations that I have learned and implemented in my labs.

1. [Part 1 - Unix Lab Codes](#part-1)
2. [Part 2 - Unix Lab Codes](#part-2)

## Part 1

The codes in Part 1 are a collection of Unix-based scripts and programs that I have written for my lab assignments. These scripts are designed to explore basic Unix commands, file management, process handling, and more.

You can download the attached PDF from the repo for a detailed explanation of the codes in Part 1.

**Credits**:  
A big thank you to [Roshan Sharma](https://github.com/RoshanSharma999) for their contributions to Part 1 of the lab codes.

## Part 2

The second part of the lab codes is available here through this link and also in the repo:  
[Unix Lab Codes - Part 2](https://local-lime-e66.notion.site/Unix-Lab-Codes-part-2-18e0f200a32080aab558e3e36f4494d5).

This part covers advanced Unix topics such as APIs and scripting for system automation.
